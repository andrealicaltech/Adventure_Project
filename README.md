# Instructions

In this assignment, you will write a [text adventure game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_fiction) of your choice.  This assignment focuses on the `input` function, writing `if` statements, and writing `while` loops!

## Required Task (`boring_adventure.py` file)
Your first task is to change the existing text adventure (in the file `boring_adventure.py`) to add an extra required "action" before the user is allowed to "sleep".  We recommend an action like "go to interhouse" or something like that.  The user should be required to both do your task and "do work" before the "sleep" option works.

## Creative Task (`fun_adventure.py` file)
Now, we'd like you to completely change the adventure so it's actually something interesting.  You should write this FUN adventure in the `fun_adventure.py` file! Choose a theme and a story and make your own adventure!  It can be as interesting or complicated as you like, but it must have at least **six** "actions" total!
